BLT Learn
=========

A small C++23 experiment sandbox that uses the BLT with Graphics framework to render and interact with a simple grid‑world (Frozen‑Lake‑like) environment. The project integrates ImGui and FreeType via the vendored blt-with-graphics subproject and builds with CMake.

Status: early exploration/prototyping.


Features
- C++23 project with clean CMake setup
- Uses BLT_WITH_GRAPHICS (windowing, 2D batch renderer, cameras, ImGui integration)
- Demonstrates a 4×4 grid world with states (Start, Frozen, Hole, Goal) and stochastic transitions
- Runs cross‑platform where a C++23 compiler and OpenGL‑capable environment are available


Repository layout
- CMakeLists.txt — Top‑level build script (defines the blt-learn executable)
- src/ — Application source (main entry point, grid world logic and rendering)
- include/ — Project headers (if any)
- lib/blt-with-graphics — Vendored graphics/game utility library (brings ImGui, FreeType, etc.)
- java/ — Java directory present in repo (not used by the C++ target)
- default.nix — Nix expression for reproducible environments (optional)


Build requirements
- CMake ≥ 3.25
- A C++23‑capable compiler (e.g., GCC 13+, Clang 16+, MSVC 19.36+)
- OpenGL‑capable runtime and standard development tools for your platform

Third‑party dependencies such as ImGui and FreeType are handled via the blt-with-graphics subproject and are fetched/built automatically by CMake.


Building (CLion / command line)
This repository is already configured with several CLion CMake profiles. Please use one of the existing generation directories; do not create new ones.

Available targets
- blt-learn (executable) — main application
- BLT_WITH_GRAPHICS, BLT, freetype (libraries) — linked as part of the build

Available profiles (pre‑generated by CLion)
- Debug → build dir: cmake-build-debug
- Debug Addrsan → build dir: cmake-build-debug-addrsan
- Release → build dir: cmake-build-release
- RelWithDebInfo → build dir: cmake-build-relwithdebinfo
- RelWithDebInfo Addrsan → build dir: cmake-build-relwithdebinfo-addrsan

Quick build from a terminal
- Debug build:
  cmake --build cmake-build-debug --target blt-learn

- Release build:
  cmake --build cmake-build-release --target blt-learn

- With AddressSanitizer (if the profile is generated):
  cmake --build cmake-build-debug-addrsan --target blt-learn

Note: These commands assume you’ve already configured the project (CLion does this automatically). If configuring from scratch, run CMake configure to generate one of the above build directories first.


Running
After building, run the executable from the chosen build directory. Examples:
- ./cmake-build-debug/blt-learn
- ./cmake-build-release/blt-learn

The application opens a window and renders a simple 4×4 grid world. ImGui may present tweakable parameters depending on the current code.


Configuration options (CMake)
The top‑level CMakeLists.txt exposes several options:
- ENABLE_ADDRSAN (OFF by default) — Enable AddressSanitizer flags
- ENABLE_UBSAN (OFF) — Enable UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer flags
- ENABLE_TSAN (OFF) — Enable ThreadSanitizer flags
- BUILD_BLT_LEARN_EXAMPLES (OFF) — Example programs hook (currently unused)
- BUILD_BLT_LEARN_TESTS (OFF) — Test programs hook (currently unused)

Additionally, compile options enable warnings and propagate sanitizer flags to both compile and link steps. The executable links to BLT_WITH_GRAPHICS.


Troubleshooting
- Missing OpenGL/driver support: Ensure your system supports the required OpenGL context and that drivers are up‑to‑date.
- Build fails fetching third‑party deps: Check your internet connection; delete the affected build directory under cmake-build-*/_deps and rebuild.
- Linker complains about sanitizer runtime: Use one of the provided “Addrsan” CLion profiles, or configure ENABLE_ADDRSAN=ON at configure time and ensure your toolchain has the sanitizer runtime installed.
- IDE IntelliSense errors but build succeeds: Some heavy template headers in BLT/parallel-hashmap may confuse static analyzers; prefer compiling to validate.


Development notes
- C++ standard is set to C++23 in CMakeLists.txt.
- The main executable sources are all files matched by src/*.cpp.
- The project uses warnings: -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic (with -Wno-comment) and optional -fsanitize flags.
- If you add new source files, place them under src/ or include/ and CMake will pick up sources via the existing glob.
